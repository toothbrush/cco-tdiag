# TODO: change from here on.

FOR THE RUSHED

$ tar xvvzf bibtex2html-0.1.tar.gz
$ cd bibtex2html-0.1/
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install
$ cat exampleX.bib | parse-bib | bib2html | pp-html > output.html
$ open output.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE IMPATIENT

To get started, unpack this tarball (evidently this was successful if you're reading
this), and run:

$ cabal configure
$ cabal build

and optionally 

$ cabal install # this is so you can run the commands directly, 
                # without invocations like `dist/build/parse-bib/parse-bib`. 

For documentation:

$ cabal haddock

Documentation gets placed in dist/doc/html/bibtex2html/index.html (this is a good starting
point). To try out the various examples, assuming you have run `cabal install`, try 
the following:

$ cat exampleX.bib | parse-bib | bib2html | pp-html > output.html

or if you'd rather not install:

$ cat exampleX.bib | dist/build/parse-bib/parse-bib | dist/build/bib2html/bib2html \
      | dist/build/pp-html/pp-html > output.html

and open the generated file, output.html, in a web browser. This process may take a while, 
so don't be surprised if it's not finished after 5 seconds. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES

A number of examples are included, see ./example?.bib, the specifics of each examle
will be explained in the comments. The examples illustrate the features of this 
implementation of bib2html. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE PATIENT (or the more curious)

Note that instead of a Makefile, Cabal's more advanced build system is used. This solves a 
lot of ugly things one runs into when using Makefiles for a small Haskell project.

Features

This implementation of BibTeX2HTML is not comprehensive, i.e. there are some aspects of 
the BibTeX DSL that aren't handled yet, but it provides a very reasonable subset of the 
BibTeX features, and the author believes that it is useful for most mainstream databases.
The most notable features are listed below.

* Warns about unknown fields, and hides these
* Checks that required fields are filled in
* Forgiving parsing, thanks to use of UU-Parsinglib
* Supports year-field without quotes
* Support for the @preamble construct
* Automatic sorting of fields within entries, and entries themselves
* Checks for duplicate keys (and only displays first definition)
* Allows for comments (% ...), both after code and on their own line
* Filters duplicate fields in entries (i.e. "author" defined twice)
* Warnings for all detected errors

In a future version, possibilities for improvement include:

* Support for escaping characters
* Automatic formatting of authors' names
* Nicer hyperlinks (i.e. Johnson 2002 -> [J02])
* Support for variables (@string) 

Requirements:

This package has been tested on Mac OS X.6 and Linux 2.6.35, using GHC6.12.3 and GHC7.0.1.
Also required are at least the following packages (can be obtained via the Haskell Cabal):

- cco
- uu-parsinglib
- haskell98

Documentation:

For extensive documentation, as well as a report detailing implementational details and 
architecture of this suite, we refer the reader to the Haddock generated documentation. 
This can be obtained by running

$ cabal haddock

and opening the resulting file, dist/doc/html/bibtex2html/index.html. This file includes
an introduction as well as links to the rest of the documentation. For completeness, a
PDF version of the Haddock documentation is included, but the recommendation is to 
use the HTML version. The PDF version of Haddock can be found in ./haddock.pdf. It can be
generated from source by running:

$ cd latex-doc/
$ pdflatex main
